# rps-odin
This was one of the first web dev projects I had made. It was part of theOdinProject curriculum. I was inspired by the look and feel of [hand drawn buttons](https://codemyui.com/hand-sketched-3d-wireframe-buttons/) and decided to make it the central theme of the app.

I used gifs for the action buttons, coded the logic in Vanilla JS, and styled it using global CSS.
